# Hello!
I'm Fausto Passerini, a computer engineer working as a full stack dev. For languages, I'm most familiar with Typescript, Java and C. For frameworks, I mostly use React. But I'm always looking to broaden my horizons. My main tools are maven and a little bit of docker. My main interest in the field is machine learning, and don't get me started on the singularity.

Right now, my main project is [Gordian](https://github.com/FaustoSP/gordian), an issue tracker where I practice and showcase some of the knowledge that I acquired in my professional career. If you want to see what I can do, please check it out, the readme has gifs that demonstrates the main functionality.
